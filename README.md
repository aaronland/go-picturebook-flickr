# go-picturebook-flickr

Create a PDF file (a "picturebook") from a folder containing images, with support for images exported from Flickr.

## Tools

To build binary versions of these tools run the `cli` Makefile target. For example:

```
$> make cli
go build -mod vendor -o bin/picturebook cmd/picturebook/main.go
```

### picturebook

Create a PDF file (a "picturebook") from a folder containing images, with support for images exported from Flickr.

```

  -verbose
    	Display verbose output as the picturebook is created.

### Notes

The `picturebook` tool does not download photos from Flickr. That is left to another process to do using the [Flickr API](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/).

It also makes the following assumptions about file names and file structures:

* The original photo has been downloaded. This is the photo with the `_o.{EXTENSION}` suffix.
* That the results of the [flickr.photos.getInfo](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.getInfo.html) API method have been captured and stored in a file with the same ID and secret as the original photo, ending in `_i.json`, in the same directory as the original photo itself.

For example:

```
$> ls -la 168662172
total 160
-rw-r--r--  1 user  staff   1342 Jul 21  2013 7168662172_7464be4db8_i.json
-rw-r--r--  1 user  staff  23111 May 11  2012 7168662172_7464be4db8_o.jpg
-rw-r--r--  1 user  staff   4078 Jul 21  2013 7168662172_b8018fcd92_t.jpg
-rw-r--r--  1 user  staff  42735 May 11  2012 7168662172_b8018fcd92_z.jpg
```

## Handlers

The `picturebook` application supports a number of "handlers" for customizing which images are included, how and whether they are transformed before inclusion and how to derive that image's caption.

In addition to the default `picturebook` handlers this package exports the following:

### Captions

```
type Caption interface {
	Text(context.Context, *blob.Bucket, string) (string, error)
}
```

#### flickr://

This handler will derive the title for a Flickr photo using data stored in a `{PHOTO_ID}_{SECRET}_i.json` file, alongside an image. The data in the file is expected to be the out of a call to the [flickr.photos.getInfo](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.getInfo.html) API method.

### Filters

```
type Filter interface {
	Continue(context.Context, *blob.Bucket, string) (bool, error)
}
```

#### flickr://

This handler will ensure that only images whose filename matches `o_\..*$` are included.
